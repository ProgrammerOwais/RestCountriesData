## My process

My process is simple but effective.
Mostly I prefer vanilla process & sometimes I use React.js if needed but without
important need, I don't use Frameworks. It is purely build with HTML5,CSS3 & JavaScript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript Function Base

### What I learned

This project helps me a lot, to recover the topics again like CSSS grid responsive behaviour,
APIs accessing, gettting & manipulating & making HTML sturucture responsive without using too much elements. After completing the project, now I gain more experience & I am very confident to working
with 3rd party APIs.
